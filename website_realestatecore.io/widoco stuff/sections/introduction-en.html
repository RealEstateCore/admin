<i>Disclaimer: This is an invite-only version of the RealEstateCore ontology.<br>
It is work-in-progress and formal errors exists. <br>
Current version is based on merging the upper ontology, Core, with the modules Building and Device. <br>
During April 2018, the modules AccessControl and Energy are expected to be added and the documentation should reflect the modularization.</i>

<h2 id="intro" class="list">What is RealEstateCore? <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
<span class="markdown">
RealEstateCore is the common language that will enable control over building and development of new services – the enabler of the promises of the digital transformation. A domain ontology preparing the buildings to interact with the Smart City made by and for property owners.

<h3 id="ns" class="list">What are the benefits for the property owners?</h3>
Property owners use the RealEstateCore ontology to describe the data of interaction within the buildings that they operate, and the management, storage, and sharing of this data. More specific, the collection of different metadata schemes, its interconnection, and uses to describe buildings, inhabitants, events etc.

The RealEstateCore focuses on merging and bridging three domains:
<ul>
  <li>Digital representation of the building’s elements (e.g. BIM)</li>
  <li>Control and operation of the building (e.g. Haystack, Ashrae standards)</li>
  <li>Emerging IoT technologies (e.g. SSN, WoT, IPSO)</li>
</ul>  

<h3 id="ns" class="list">One more standard?</h3>
RealEstateCore is not a new standard. RealEstateCore uses and maps present standards in a pragmatic manner – a minimum viable design.
Mappings to new standards are easy done by the user by adding an annotation (and possible shared with the community).
<br>
<i>Note for this version: The mappings to other standards are annotations (e.g. "IFCComparable") and will be added to this documentation i upcoming revision</i>

<h3 id="ns" class="list">The RealEstateCore consist of a set of modules and controlled vocabularies</h3>
The moduls describe the specifics for a building like core (time, units etc.), building structure, and devices.
<br>
The Schemas are the controlled vocabulary (similar to tags in Haystack) that enables the interoperability of data (e.g. that temperature data collected from different systems has the same name).

<h3 id="ns" class="list">Openness – Share the knowledge in order to scale</h3>
A consortium is formed with <a href='https://www.vasakronan.se'>Vasakronan AB</a>, <a href='https://www.akademiskahus.se'>Akademiska Hus AB</a>, <a href='https://klipsk.io'>Klipsk AB</a>, and <a href='https://www.willhem.se/'>Willhem AB</a> as the founders and main sponsors.
<br>
The purpose of the consortium is to create an environment for cooperation and sharing of knowledge between property owners and partners.
