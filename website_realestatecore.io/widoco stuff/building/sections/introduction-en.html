<h2 id="intro" class="list">Introduction <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
Since the Jetsons cartoon and in numerous science fiction movies, we have seen the future of smart buildings. We know what it should be like. And we have been waiting for the smartness to come … <br>
<br>
RealEstateCore is one of many stepping stones that are needed to make it happen.<br>
<div id="whydoweneedrec">
<h3 id="ns" class="list">Why do we need the RealEstateCore?</h3>
Ever increasing amounts of data are generated by and within buildings. Several different systems exist to control climate, lighting, access control, etc., not to mention all the new data sources that emerge from IoT devices, all of which generate data. These large amounts of heterogeneous data need to be organized if they are to contribute to cost-efficient and environmentally friendly real estate management.
<br>
<br>
We use Semantic Web technologies combined with a business-usefulness-approach; the result is the RealEstateCore (REC) ontology.

<div id="modules">
<h3 id="ns" class="list">Modules to make it customizable</h3>
RealEstateCore consists of a set of modules, which in the current version include:
<ul>
<li><a href='http://realestatecore.io/doc/core/index-en.html'>Core</a>  (covering shared concepts and properties that occur in two or more other modules, e.g. time, units, agents, etc. – this module)</li>
<li>Building (e.g. building type specific vocabularies)</li>
<li><a href='http://realestatecore.io/doc/device/index-en.html'>Device</a> (e.g. communication-tech specific vocabularies and classes)</li>
</ul>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The purpose of using different modules to model domain-specific details is to facilitate customization for each user, e.g. a fictitious RetailPropertyOwner might use the Core and Device modules just as they are, but might want to modify the Building module to reflect the type of business that they do (e.g., by providing a more suitable taxonomy of room types for retail real estate).
<br>
<br>
The Core module is an upper ontology supporting the more specific modules that model domain specific details. This structure makes it easy to in the future add more domain ontologies to expand the usefulness of the RealEstateCore.
<br>
<br>
During Q2-2018, the RealEstateCore consortium is planning to develop modules covering Access Control (door locks, etc. ) and Energy (consumers, producers, storage, prioritizations, etc.).
</div>

<div id="building">
<h3 id="ns" class="list">What is the Building ontology used for?</h3>
The Building ontology is a module that complements the Core ontology with vocabularies for room types and can be extended or modified to suite individual needs.
<br>
<br>
The current version of the Building ontology module consists of room types suited for commercial spaces. Users of the RealEstateCore are encouraged to add their own room types, premises types etc.
<br>
<br>
Use the Building ontology module to describe things related to the building’s structural components.
